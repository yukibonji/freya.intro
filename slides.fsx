## `Freya.Core`

* Basic abstractions over OWIN
* `freya` computation expression (the wrapping abstraction for our mutable state -- we will never speak of this in polite conversation)
* Set of operators to use `freya` computation expressions in a more concise way
* Some basic functions and **lenses** to give access to the state in a controllable way

***
*)

type Freya<'T> =
    FreyaState -> Async<'T * FreyaState>
(**

Roughly equivalent to Erlang's webmachine signature:

```
f(ReqData, State) ->
    {RetV, ReqData, State}.
```

***
*)

type FreyaState =
    { Environment: FreyaEnvironment
      Meta: FreyaMetaState }

    static member internal EnvironmentLens =
        (fun x -> x.Environment), 
        (fun e x -> { x with Environment = e })

    static member internal MetaLens =
        (fun x -> x.Meta), 
        (fun m x -> { x with Meta = m })

and FreyaMetaState =
    { Memos: Map<Guid, obj> }

    static member internal MemosLens =
        (fun x -> x.Memos),
        (fun m x -> { x with Memos = m })

(**

## Lenses?

*)

let ``getLM, setLM, modLM behave correctly`` () =
    let m =
        freya {
            do! setLM answerLens 42
            let! v1 = getLM answerLens

            do! modLM answerLens ((*) 2)
            let! v2 = getLM answerLens

            return v1, v2 }

    let result = run m

    fst result =? (42, 84)

## OWIN Integration

*)

/// Type alias of <see cref="FreyaEnvironment" /> in terms of OWIN.
type OwinEnvironment =
    FreyaEnvironment

/// Type alias for the F# equivalent of the OWIN AppFunc signature.
type OwinApp = 
    OwinEnvironment -> Async<unit>

/// Type alias for the OWIN AppFunc signature.
type OwinAppFunc = 
    Func<OwinEnvironment, Task>

(**
***
## Use OWIN in Freya
*)

let ``freya computation can compose with an OwinAppFunc`` () =
    let app =
        OwinAppFunc(fun (env: OwinEnvironment) ->
            env.["Answer"] <- 42
            Task.FromResult<obj>(null) :> Task)

    let converted = OwinAppFunc.toFreya app

    let m =
        freya {
            do! converted
            let! v1 = getLM answerLens
            return v1 }
    
    let result = run m
    fst result =? 42

(**
***
## Convert Freya to OWIN
*)

let ``freya computation can roundtrip to and from OwinAppFunc`` () =
    let app = setLM answerLens 42

    let converted =
        app
        |> OwinAppFunc.fromFreya
        |> OwinAppFunc.toFreya

    let m =
        freya {
            do! converted
            let! v1 = getLM answerLens
            return v1 }
    
    let result = run m
    fst result =? 42

(**
***

## `Freya.Pipeline`

* Very small and simple -- all about composing `freya` computations in a way that represents a continue/halt processing pipeline
* A pipeline is simply a `freya` computation that returns `Next` or `Halt` (`FreyaPipelineChoice` cases)
* Single, simple operator: `>?=`

***
*)

let ``pipeline executes both monads if first returns next`` () =
    let o1 = modM (fun x -> x.Environment.["o1"] <- true; x) *> next
    let o2 = modM (fun x -> x.Environment.["o2"] <- true; x) *> next

    let choice, env = run (o1 >?= o2)

    choice =? Next
    unbox env.Environment.["o1"] =? true
    unbox env.Environment.["o2"] =? true

let ``pipeline executes only the first monad if first halts`` () =
    let o1 = modM (fun x -> x.Environment.["o1"] <- true; x) *> halt
    let o2 = modM (fun x -> x.Environment.["o2"] <- true; x) *> next

    let choice, env = run (o1 >?= o2)

    choice =? Halt
    unbox env.Environment.["o1"] =? true
    unbox env.Environment.["o2"] =? false

(**
***

## `Freya.Recorder`

* Build introspection into the framework at a low level
* Provide some infrastructure for recording metadata about processing that more specific implemenations can use
* For example, `Freya.Machine` records the execution process so it can be examined later

***

## `Freya.Types.*`

* Set of libraries providing F# types which map (very closely) to various specifications, such as HTTP, URI, LanguageTag, etc.
* These are used throughout the higher level stack projects
* Always favor strongly-typed representations of data over strings
* Provides parsers, formatters (statically on the types) and lenses from state to that type (either total or partial)

***

## Really?

* Why not use `System.Net.Whatever`?
* Well ...

***

![Ask the UriKind. One. More. Time.](images/ask-the-urikind.png)

***

## `Freya.Types.*`

* Types and parsers for when you don't already know everything about the string you've been given
* Types which map closely to HTTP specifications
* Types which can distinguish between different kinds of URIs being valid in different places
* Types which can actually express languages that aren't "en-US"
* ("hy-Latn-IT-arevela"? Of course we support Aremenian with a Latin script as spoken in Northern Italy why do you ask?)

***

## Integration with existing standards

## [OWIN](http://owin.org/)

*)

Func<IDictionary<string, obj>, Task>

(**

* Standard contract between servers and apps/frameworks
* Several server implementations, including IIS
* Reasonably well followed standard

***

## `Freya.Router`

* A simple, trie-based router, does pretty much what you'd expect
* Doesn't try and do anything but route requests to pipelines
* (and is itself a pipeline -- everything's composable / nestable!)

***

## `Freya.Machine`

* A "machine" style resource definition / processing library
* Inspired by projects like webmachine (Erlang) and Liberator (Clojure)
* Adds types

***

## `Freya.Inspector`

* Built-in introspection
* Has an extensibility model (WIP)
* Right now provides an API; UI in-progress

***

## `Freya.*.Inspector`

* Component-specific extensions to the inspector, currently providing component-specific JSON for the inspection API
* Will provide UI extensions, too, but haven't decided on the best approach to that (suggestions welcome, of course)

***

## OWIN Design

* OWIN design is very simple for [historically meaningful reasons](http://panesofglass.github.io/history-of-owin/)
* Assumes mutation and side effects
* Uses simple types and works with any .NET language

***

## OWIN Design

* `Task`s (not `Task<T>`)
* Dictionary of state (`IDictionary<string, obj>`)
* Defined keys contain boxed objects of known types (some keys are optional)
  * e.g., request headers are "owin.RequestHeaders" defined as an `IDictionary<string, string[]>`
  * spec includes rules governing side effects in some cases

***

## OWIN Design

* Servers should take action when certain elements in the environment dictionary change
* E.g., writing to the body stream, "owin.ResponseBody" typed as `System.IO.Stream`, flushes the headers, and you should no longer be able to write headers
* This design makes life difficult from the perspective of functional purity
